Monty Stack Implementation

This project implements a simple stack data structure in C language. The stack operations will be based on the Monty bytecode files.

-Learning Objectives

Understand LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) concepts
Implement a stack data structure in C
Work with Monty bytecode files

-Monty Bytecode Files

Monty bytecode files contain instructions for the Monty bytecode interpreter. Each instruction corresponds to a stack operation such as push or pop. You will need to implement the logic for each instruction in your C code.

-Further Considerations

Error handling for invalid bytecode instructions or stack overflow/underflow conditions
Unit testing your code to ensure it works as expected
